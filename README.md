# SDL3 Template Project with CMake

This template project is for SDL3 in C/C++. It uses CMake.
Before starting, you might want to change the project name. And include/exclude libraries.
Currently, the libraries are all commented out and no linking is done. The program
will simply just compile and print an "Hello, World!" message to the console.
