# ToDo CLI Tool

> This is work in progress and is used to learn how C works.

A simple command lind tool to create and manage simple todo's.

The format of the todo file is rather simple.

```
- Unchecked todo
+ Checked todo
```

- The "- " prefix is for the unchecked todo.
- The "+ " prefix is for the checked todo.

## How to build.

Only need a standard C compiler.

Run this for compiling the build system:

```
cc -o nob nob.c
```

and then run:

```
./nob
```

This will build the `toci` binary.
